/*
* Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents,
* and we have infinite supply of each of S = {S1, S2, ..., Sm} valued coins,
* how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins does not matter.
*
* For example, for N = 4 and S = {1, 2, 3},
* there are four ways: {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2}, {2, 2}, {1, 3}.
* So output should be 4.
* For N = 10 and S = {2, 3, 5, 6},
* there are five ways: {2, 2, 2, 2, 2}, {2, 2, 3, 3}, {2, 2, 6}, {2, 3, 5} and {5, 5}. 
* So the output should be 5.
